# scale-hiring-automation

Automated the scale hiring of employees by creating an application on Google Apps Script. The application can even be used by a layman to directly hire an employee by sending an offer letter to the same. It also adds him/her to the company's website, Slack team and default channels and also the company Trello board where the employee will be listed the default tasks for first week. The automation also follows the removal of an employee in the same order.
